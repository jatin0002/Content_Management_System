Content Management System API

## Requirements

For development, you will need Node.js and a node global package.

### Node
- #### Node installation on Windows

Just go to [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version

    $ npm --version

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g


## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PROJECT_TITLE
    $ cd PROJECT_TITLE
    $ npm install

## Running the project in production

    $ npm start

## Running the project in developement phase

    $ npm run dev


## For Database

we choose MongoDB.

for local set DB = mongodb://localhost:27017/blog in env file
for MongoDB cloud set DB = mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.63xa1.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority in env file

or use MongoDB Atlas
(You can find MongoDB Atlas [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try)).

First create your account if already created then Signin.
Then build cluster and set organization name and project name and choose preferred language.
Then in Shared Clusters select `Create a Free`.
Then click in `Create Cluster` in bottom.(It take some time)
Then click in `CONNECT`.
Then click on `Connect Your Application`
Also set Ip address(Must)
    click on `Network Access`.
    then click on `Add IP Address`
Then copy url and paste in .env file
    DB = mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.63xa1.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
